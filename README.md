# Analyzing-Robustness-and-Incentive-Weighted-for-False-Data-Injection-Attacks-Prediction
This project aimed at enhancing the security of smart grids by developing a machine learning-based method to predict and prevent False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA). The model utilized a variety of classifiers trained on extensive smart grid datadets to distinguish between normal and anomalous data indicative of attacks. Key steps included data exploration and cleaning, feature selection and extraction, and model training using algorithms such as Logistics Regression, XGBoost, Bagging, Random Forest, and Extra Trees Classifiers. The project demonstrated high accuracy in detecting various types of smart grid attacks, showing significant potential in improving the resilience and safety of critical infrastructure.
